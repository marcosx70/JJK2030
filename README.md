# JJK2030

**JJK2030** is a Roblox MMORPG project inspired by the world and mechanics of *Jujutsu Kaisen*. The goal is to create an immersive, high-stakes experience featuring deep combat systems, faction-based progression, player-driven quests, and an evolving world.

## ðŸ§  Key Features To Be Developed

* **R6-based custom combat system** with air combos, parries, stuns, and VFX
* **Heavenly restrictions**, CE pool, CE efficiency, Six Eyes, RCT systems
* **Factions, guilds, associations** with quests, upgrades, and raids
* **Permadeath mechanics** with second wind, reincarnation effects, and unlockables
* **Crafting and drop systems** from curses for weapons and cursed tools
* **Class-based PVP and PVE** designed for risk and reward

## ðŸš€ Workflow Guidelines

* Use branches when testing major features
* Document all major systems in the `shared/` folder using module scripts
* Commit small, descriptive changes (e.g., `add dash mechanic`, `refactor input handler`)

## ðŸ¤– Dev Tools

* **VS Code + Git** for version control
* **Copilot + GPT-4o** to assist writing Luau and documenting logic
* **Todo Tree & Bookmarks** to manage priorities in-code
* **Roblox Studio** for building, testing, and uploading assets

## ðŸ“Œ Project Notes

* The `README.md` will evolve as new systems are designed
* All custom assets (animations, VFX, models) should be stored in `/assets`
* Client-side scripts should be modular and performance aware
* Server-side scripts must validate inputs (anti-exploit)
