1. Edit the MovementController script to have the fixes mentioned in the first section and tell me any changes that may affect things outside of MovementController
2. I will add stamina very far down the line but if it will cause large problems making stamina after this draft of the game then explain to me now how it will cause problems. Creating movementstats should become a priority because it will help attach movement related values to the player character. This need to be accounted for inside the movementcontroller so please edit movementstats into the script and explain how it works with the script and now its fulfilling its potential as a system impacting movement based on playerstats.
